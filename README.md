# Predicting Spam Emails: A Classification Problem
The objective of this project is to predict spam emails from a dataset that contains randomly picked emails and their respective labels. The csv file contains 5712 rows and 3002 columns, where each column represent a word, and each row represents an observation with the respective word counts. The final column is a target label of whether the email is spam or not. The dataset is extracted from Kaggle.

We have trained and tested three classification models: Logistic Regression, KNN Classifier, and Decision Tree Classifier, to predict spam emails. We recommend using Logistic Regression for prediction, as it resulted in an F1-score of 0.95. Moreover, we were able to extract feature importance and identify the words of most occurance in spam emails.
